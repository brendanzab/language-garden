(** {0 CPU based shader language} *)

(** This implements a shader language natively in OCaml. This is useful for
    testing the shader language and SDFs without needing to interface with
    graphics APIs. It could also be useful for implementing constant folding
    optimisations in the future. *)

    that pixel. *)
