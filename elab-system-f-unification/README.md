# Bidirectional type checking and unification for higher-rank polymorphism

Extends [**elab-system-f-bidirectional**](../elab-system-f-bidirectional).

An elaborator for a higher-rank polymorphic lambda calculus where explicit
type applications and type annotations can be omitted.

```text
let id [a] (x : a) := x;
let always [a] (x : a) [b] (y : b) := x;

let _ := id 3;
let _ := id id;
let _ := always id 3;

-- Call a polymorphic function with two different types
let test (f : [a] -> a -> a) : Bool :=
  let _ := f 3;
  f true;

test (fun x => x)

The approach to unification-with levels was mainly based on Mark Barboneâ€™s
[implementation](https://gist.github.com/mb64/87ac275c327ea923a8d587df7863d8c7)
of higher-rank polymorphism. Note that we do not implement polymorphic subtyping
in this implementation.
