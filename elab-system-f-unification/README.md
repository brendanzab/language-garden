# Bidirectional type checking and pattern unification for higher-rank polymorphism

Extends [**elab-system-f-bidirectional**](../elab-system-f-bidirectional).

An elaborator for a higher-rank polymorphic lambda calculus where explicit
type applications and type annotations can be omitted.

```text
let id [a] (x : a) := x;
let always [a] (x : a) [b] (y : b) := x;

always id 33
```

The approach to unification-with levels was mainly based on Mark Barboneâ€™s
[implementation](https://gist.github.com/mb64/87ac275c327ea923a8d587df7863d8c7)
of higher-rank polymorphism. Note that we do not implement polymorphic subtyping
in this implementation.

## Examples

```sh
$ system-f-unification elab <<< "fun [a] (x : a) => x"
fun [a] => fun (x : a) => x : [a] -> a -> a
```

```sh
$ system-f-unification elab <<< "(fun [a] (x : a) => x) 3"
(fun [a] => fun (x : a) => x) [Int] 3 : Int
```

```sh
$ system-f-unification norm <<< "(fun [a] (x : a) [b] (y : b) => x) 3"
fun [b] => fun (y : b) => 3 : [b] -> b -> Int
```
