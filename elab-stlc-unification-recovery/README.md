# Simply typed lambda calculus with unification

- Extends [**elab-stlc-unification**](../elab-stlc-unification) (+ error recovery)

---

This extends [elab-stlc-unification](../elab-stlc-unification) with support for
reporting multiple errors during type checking. This is important for real-world
programming language implementations, as we donâ€™t want our type checkers to stop
on the first error, potentially hiding other errors until the program is
re-checked.
