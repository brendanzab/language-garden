# Miscellaneous scraps

I’m not really ready to add these to the top-level direcotry. They also lack
build system support and are untested for now.

- [**compile-arith-rust**](./compile-arith-rust/):
  Arithmetic expression evaluators and compilers in Rust.
- [**compile-arith-verified**](./compile-arith-verified/):
  A formally verified arithmetic expression compiler and decompiler in Lean 4.
- [**check-stlc-bidir.rs**](./check-stlc-bidir.rs):
  Bidirectional type checker for a simple functional language
- [**check-stlc-inference-rules.ml**](./check-stlc-inference-rules.ml):
  A demo of translating inference rules for the STLC into a type inference algorithm
- [**check-dependent.pl**](./check-dependent.pl):
  A small dependent type system, implemented in SWI-Prolog using normalisation-by-evaluation.
