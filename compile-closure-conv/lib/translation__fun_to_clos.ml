(** {0 Typed closure conversion on nameless terms}

    Translation from {!Lang.Fun} to {!Lang.Clos}.

    This translation converts functions into closures, separating the code of
    functions from the data implicitly captured from the surrounding environment.
    It’s a modified version of the algorithm described in {{:https://doi.org/10.1145/1291201.1291212}
    “A type-preserving closure conversion in haskell”}, using de Bruijn levels
    to simplify the handling of variable bindings.

    The implementation is somewhat fiddly due to the decision to use de Bruijn
    indices in the source and target languages. {!Translate.FunAToClosA} uses
    alpha renamed terms, which simplifies this somewhat.

    Note that we don’t do any uncurrying during this translation, which results
    in more closures being constructed than might otherwise be necessary.

(** {1 Values} *)

(** Values used when substituting source terms for closure converted target
    terms. We only need to worry about variables and projections on variables,
    as those are the only values that will be stored in the environment during
    compilation.

    Variables are represented using de Bruijn levels, allowing us to freely
    weaken the target environment (i.e. add new bindings) without needing to
    worry about shifting de Bruijn indices.
