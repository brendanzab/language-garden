# Simply typed lambda calculus with unification

Extends [**elab-stlc-bidirectional**](../elab-stlc-bidirectional).

This an elaborator for a simply typed lambda calculus (with booleans and integers)
that allows programmers to omit type annotations. This is done by inserting
_metavariables_ that stand-in for unknown types during elaboration. These are
later updated based on how they are used in other parts of the program.

This approach is a stepping-stone to more powerful type checking algorithms,
such as those for Hindley-Milner type systems.

This implementation was originally based on [Arad Arbelâ€™s gist](https://gist.github.com/aradarbel10/837aa65d2f06ac6710c6fbe479909b4c).

## Examples

```sh
$ stlc-unification elab <<< "fun x => x + 2"
fun (x : Int) => #int-add -x 2 : Int -> Int
```

```sh
$ stlc-unification elab <<< "fun x f => f x * x"
fun (x : Int) => fun (f : Int -> Int) => #int-mul -(f x) x :
  Int -> (Int -> Int) -> Int
```

```sh
$ stlc-unification elab <<< "fun x y => if x = 0 then y else 3"
fun (x : Int) => fun (y : Int) => if #int-eq -x 0 then y else 3 :
  Int -> Int -> Int
```
