(** {0 Surface language}

    The surface language closely mirrors what the programmer originaly wrote,
    including syntactic sugar and higher level language features that make
    programming more convenient (in comparison to the {!Core}).
*)

(** {1 Syntax} *)

(** The start and end position in a source file *)
type loc =
  Lexing.position * Lexing.position

(** Located nodes *)
type 'a located = {
  loc : loc;
  data : 'a;
}

(** Types in the surface language *)
type ty =
  ty_data located

and ty_data =
  | Name of string
  | FunType of ty * ty

(** Names that bind definitions or parameters *)
type binder = string located

(** Terms in the surface language *)
type tm =
  tm_data located

and tm_data =
  | Name of string
  | Let of binder * param list * ty option * tm * tm
  | Ann of tm * ty
  | FunLit of param list * tm
  | BoolLit of bool
  | IntLit of int
  | App of tm * tm
  | IfThenElse of tm * tm * tm
  | Op2 of [`Eq | `Add | `Sub | `Mul] * tm * tm
  | Op1 of [`Neg] * tm

(** Parameters, with optional type annotations *)
and param =
  binder * ty option


(** {1 Elaboration} *)

(** This is where we implement user-facing type checking, while also translating
    the surface language into the simpler, more explicit core language.

    While we {e could} translate syntactic sugar in the parser, by leaving
    this to elaboration time we make it easier to report higher quality error
    messages that are more relevant to what the programmer originally wrote.
*)


(** {2 Local bindings} *)

(** A stack of bindings currently in scope *)
type context = (string * Core.ty) Core.env

(** Lookup a name in the context *)
let lookup (ctx : context) (name : string) : (Core.index * Core.ty) option =
  ctx |> List.find_mapi @@ fun index (name', ty) ->
    match name = name' with
    | true -> Some (index, ty)
    | false -> None


(** {2 Elaboration errors} *)

(** An error that will be raised if there was a problem in the surface syntax,
    usually as a result of type errors. This is normal, and should be rendered
    nicely to the programmer. *)
exception Error of loc * string

(** Raises an {!Error} exception *)
let error (type a) (loc : loc) (message : string) : a =
  raise (Error (loc, message))

let equate_ty (loc : loc) (ty1 : Core.ty) (ty2 : Core.ty) =
  if ty1 = ty2 then () else
    error loc
      (Format.asprintf "@[<v 2>@[mismatched types:@]@ @[expected: %a@]@ @[found: %a@]@]"
        Core.pp_ty ty1
        Core.pp_ty ty2)


(** {2 Bidirectional type checking} *)

(** The algorithm is structured {i bidirectionally}, divided into mutually
    recursive {i checking} and {i inference} modes. By supplying type
    annotations as early as possible using the checking mode, we can improve
    the locality of type errors. We can also extend the type system with
    advanced features like dependent types, higher rank types, and subtyping
    while maintaining decidability by allowing the programmer to supply
    annotations where necessary. *)
