# Future proofing the simply typed lambda calculus for fancy types

Extends [**elab-stlc-bidirectional**](../elab-stlc-bidirectional).

Statically typed languages tend to evolve dependently typed features over time,
and if the surface syntax is not prepared to handle it, this can lead to awkward
compromises to avoid syntactic ambiguities. Examples of such workarounds are the
braces in Rustâ€™s generic constant arguments, the syntax for first class modules
in OCaml, and the various challenges in preparing GHC to support dependent types.

This elaborator takes a combined type and expression language and stratifies it
into a simply typed lambda calculus. This retains syntactic room in the surface
language for language features like dependent types to be added later on.

For example the following program:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/elephant.txt -->
```
let Elephant : Type := Int;
let grow (e : Elephant) : Elephant := e + 1;
grow 4
```

Will be elaborated to:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/elephant.stdout -->
```
let grow : Int -> Int := fun (e : Int) => e + 1;
grow 4 : Int
```

Local type definitions are currently inlined into type annotations during
elaboration, as they do not exist in the core language. Attempting to use
features like type parameters will result in elaboration errors, for example:

```sh
$ stlc-bidirectional-stratify elab <<< "fun (A : Type) (x : A) => x"
<input>:1:9: expected type, found universe
[1]
```

Some possible downsides to this approach are:

- It requires contextual information to decide if something is a type or not,
  which could make some language tooling more challenging to implement without
  also implementing a similar form of elaboration.
- Some programmers might be confused that types and expressions use the same
  syntax, disambiguated based on context (on the other hand, other programmers
  might find this insightful).
- A single namespace is used for types and expressions, so the same name can no
  longer be reused for both types and expressions.
- We can no longer overload the syntax of types and terms as easily, for example
  when overloading the syntax for tuple types and tuple literals.
- When introducing fancier types we might want to make staging of types explicit
  for performance reasons, which could be a breaking change.

## Todo list

- [x] Local type bindings (e.g. `let Foo : Type := Int; 1 : Foo`)
- [ ] Type parameters (e.g. `let Id (A : Type) : Type := A; 1 : Id Int`)
- [ ] Metavariables and unification (e.g. `let id (A : _) (x : A) : A := x; id _ 1`)
- [ ] Implicit type parameters (e.g. `let id {A : Type} (x : A) : A := x; id 1`)

## Examples

```sh
$ stlc-bidirectional-stratify elab <<< "Int"
Int : Type
```

```sh
$ stlc-bidirectional-stratify elab <<< "Int -> Int -> Bool"
Int -> Int -> Bool : Type
```

```sh
$ stlc-bidirectional-stratify elab <<< "Int : Type"
Int : Type
```

```sh
$ stlc-bidirectional-stratify elab <<< "Type"
Type : Type 1
```

```sh
$ stlc-bidirectional-stratify elab <<< "let Univ := Type; let Number : Univ := Int; 1 + 2 : Number"
1 + 2 : Int
```
